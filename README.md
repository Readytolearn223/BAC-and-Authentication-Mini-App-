Availability will ensure that the system is accessible when needed. Users can log in and immediately access the actions allowed for their role, ensuring uninterrupted system availability. 

# How My App Works 

My app  has two hardcoded users:  Jake, who is the admin, and Bob, who is the user. A user will choose either to log  in  as Jake or Bob. Depending on which  hardcoded username  the user  types in the app will determine their role. For example, if the user types in the user Jake, they  will become an admin and have access to the Users, Cameras, and Settings  in my app. If the user chooses not to type either  of the hardcoded users,  then they will be asked to try again.
